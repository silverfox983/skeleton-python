Anything tagged with "enhancement" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

## Write documentation 📖
The project could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official project
docs. If you're interested in helping out, check the #% if docs %#[docs/]({{repo_url}}/tree/HEAD/docs)
folder#% else %#[README file]({{repo_url}}/tree/HEAD/README.md)#% endif %# in the repository.

## Share your feedback 🌍

If you are proposing a feature:

-   Explain in detail how it would work.
-   Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
-   Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are
    welcome! ✨

## Pull Request guidelines 📝
1. Initially mark the PR as a draft, so that the maintainers know that you are making final touches.

1. Ensure that the [test coverage]({{coverage_url}}) is not decreased. If you add a new feature, please add tests for it. [Read more about coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

1. Ensure that all GitHub checks pass. If they are disabled in your PR, ping the maintainers to request enabling them.

1. Don't forget to link the relevant issue(s) in the PR description and describe the changes you made.
