My [copier](https://github.com/copier-org/copier) Python project template. Tested with [CTT](https://github.com/KyleKing/copier-template-tester).

# Motivation
I was inspired by https://blog.jaraco.com/skeleton.

The goal of this project is to provide a skeleton for my Python projects,
simultaneously trying to take on the following [jaraco/skeleton](https://github.com/jaraco/skeleton) challenges:
- Solve the [History is Forever](https://blog.jaraco.com/skeleton/#history-is-forever) problem.
  - [x] The true history is not obscured.
  - [x] Existing histories are not broken until the handoff commit is pulled.
  - [ ] Attribution is not lost.
- Solve the [Continuous Integration Mismatch](https://blog.jaraco.com/skeleton/#continuous-integration-mismatch) problem.
  - [x] Downstream projects and the skeleton itself can have different CI configurations.
- Solve the [Commit Integrations Mismatch](https://blog.jaraco.com/skeleton/#commit-integrations-mismatch) problem.
  - [x] Downstream projects and the skeleton itself can reference different issues and pull requests in their commit histories.

Because the project does not copy the whole history from skeleton, many of the problems are solved by design.

# How to use it
You might use this template or fork it and modify it to your needs.

## Configure [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)

```shell
gh auth login
```

## Install [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis#readme), [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx#readme), [keyring](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring#readme) and [Copier](https://github.com/copier-org/copier#readme)

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt install pipx redis gnome-keyring
pipx install copier keyring
pipx inject copier copier-templates-extensions tomli
SKELETON=gh:skeleton-ci/skeleton-python
```

## Create a new project
![Copy demo](./assets/copy_demo.svg)

1.  Make sure that you trust me.
2.  Run the following command:

    ```shell
    copier copy --trust --vcs-ref HEAD "$SKELETON" path/to/project
    ```

3.  Answer the questions.
4.  Change directory to your project:

    ```shell
    cd path/to/project
    ```

5. Happy coding!
Your repository is on GitHub and has:
- a release maker (`ðŸ’² poe release`),
- skeleton tool (`ðŸ’² poe skeleton [upgrade|patch]`),
- aesthetic badges in README.md,
- an auto-generated LICENSE file,
- a pre-configured `pyproject.toml` file,
- pre-configured [towncrier](https://github.com/twisted/towncrier#readme) tasks for changelog generation (`ðŸ’² poe [added|changed|deprecated|removed|fixed|security]`),
- a ready-to-use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) virtual environment with all the necessary dev dependencies installed, including [poethepoet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet#readme), [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/),
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy#readme), [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff#readme), etc.
- a pre-configured CI suite for GitHub Actions (including coverage report) and pre-commit.

## Incorporate to an existing project
Almost the same as above.

1.  Change directory to your project:

    ```shell
    cd path/to/project
    ```

1.  Run the following command:

    ```shell
    copier copy --trust --vcs-ref HEAD "$SKELETON" .
    ```

1.  Answer the questions.
1.  Allow copier to overwrite all files.
1.  Patch your files (changes were locally reverted for your convenience).
    Be sure that the codebase is not lost but files maintained by skeleton are updated.
1.  Run the following command:

    ```shell
    poe skeleton upgrade
    ```

1.  Happy coding!


## Bump the version of skeleton in your project
![Upgrade demo](./assets/upgrade_demo.svg)

```shell
poe skeleton upgrade
```

Or, for a specific [ref](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/refs-and-the-reflog):

```shell
poe skeleton upgrade 1.0.0  # Upgrade to skeleton-ci/skeleton-python@1.0.0.
poe skeleton upgrade dev  # Upgrade to the latest commit on the dev branch.
```

## Reconfigure the skeleton
```shell
poe skeleton patch
```

# How to develop

1.  Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and project dependencies.

    ```shell
    sudo apt install pipx  # If you don't have pipx installed yet.
    pipx install poetry
    pipx inject poetry "sync-pre-commit-lock[poetry]"
    poetry install
    ```
1.  Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks.

    ```shell
    pre-commit install
    ```

1.  Test your skeleton.

    ```shell
    ctt
    ```
