# This workflow exists to store pinned GitHub Actions versions.
# It is meant to be updated by dependabot when new actions are released
# in order to ensure supply chain security.
# When this template is rendered, the filter `use_actions` collects all
# actions declared in this workflow and shares them in context with
# the workflows in the `project/` core template directory.

# Motivation
# ==========
# Allowing dependabot to submit PRs to this workflow ensures that the latest versions
# of actions with all necessary security updates are quickly available to all projects.
# Keeping actions pinned ensures that there is always time to review updates
# to actions before they are merged and used in production.
